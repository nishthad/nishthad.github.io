                    <p class="lighter-text small-text">Bounce is currently in it's final design phase, with on going focus groups and usability testing. The product has been carefully designed in collaboration with physical therapists, oncologists, and breast cancer survivors.</p>

                    <p class="lighter-text med-text">Breast cancer survivors are often sedentary, mainly due to social stigma, and fear of post-op injuries. The survivors are often unmotivated and do not seek professional advise on exercising. Bounce acknowledges this, focusing on positive reinforcement, self-determination and providing a sense of freedom by allowing users to pick from the three categories - Flexibility, Strength, and Aerobics. Bounce further ensures the users are always in control by always presenting options that are easy, medium, and hard, not forcing users into any task they may not be up to.
A large part of positive reinforcement meant doing away with the too many numbers, which can often be demotivating. For this reason, the ultimate goal for each category in Bounce is to complete the circle, which fills up depending on the difficulty level of the exercise.<br><br>
Bounce acknowledges that motivation does not always come in the form of exercise goals, but often is internal, like being able to play with your child, or being well for your family. Bounce brings this front and center in the Me tab, where users are given the option to either have a text, or image as their motivation so they can internalize this, as well as be reminded before exercising.<br><br>
Bounce proactively tracks the users’ steps to inform the user that walking is exercise too. The steps tab is set up to track the users’ steps, and map them to popular attractions in the users’ city. Not only does this allow the user to visualize their activity and compare it to their real environment, but also makes these large tasks seem more achievable. The step tracking helps users internally set goals to increase their steps each week, without being told to do so.</p>
